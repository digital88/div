# Docker Image Viewer - div

Standalone app to download and view docker image contents. No docker cli required.

Currently is WIP.

Heavily inspired by this bash scripts:
* ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moby/moby/master/contrib/download-frozen-image-v2.sh``` 
* ```https://github.com/matya/download-docker-image/blob/master/download-docker-image.sh```
